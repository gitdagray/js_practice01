# Practice Assignment 1

_Need help getting the files? Scroll down to the section called "[Getting the files for the Practice Assignment](#getting-the-files-for-the-practice-assignment)"._

## Assignment Directions

You can run this practice assignment directly in VS Code. I recommend installing the [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) as a mock web server.

_Once you are working with your own copy of the project..._

**Complete the problems listed in the main.js** javascript file
according to the instructions given in the comments.

_DO NOT CHANGE any of the pre-existing code in main.js or any other files._

To see your score, go to the web page that the Live Server Extension launches for the project on your computer when you click "Go Live" near the bottom right of VS Code. It's usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/` or `http://localhost:5500/`. 

Alternate way to use Live Server: Right click in the index.html file. From the context menu, choose "Open with Live Server".

Did you miss some points/problems?

It's ok. Go back and make corrections. Then check your score again!

When you are ready to submit your work, follow the instructions that are at the top of the score page.

## Getting the files for the Practice Assignment

Follow these steps to download (or "clone") this repository to your computer so you can work on the assignment.

### Option 1: Clone with Git (Recommended)

Cloning allows you to keep a connection between your computer and GitHub.  
This makes it easier to pull updates.

1. **Install Git** (if you don’t already have it):  
   - [Download Git here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Open a terminal or command prompt** on your computer.

3. **Navigate to the folder** where you want to save the assignment. For example:  
   
       `cd Documents/Projects`

4. **Copy the repository link** from GitHub:  
   - On this repository’s GitHub page, click the green **Code** button.  
   - Copy the HTTPS link (it looks like this):  
     
       `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git`

5. **Run the clone command** in your terminal:  
   
       `git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git`

6. **Go into the new folder**:  
   
       `cd repository-name`

7. Open the folder with VS Code or your choice of editor.

Now you have the assignment files on your computer!

### Option 2: Download as a ZIP (Quick & Easy)

If you don’t want to use Git yet, you can simply download the files.

1. On this repository’s GitHub page, click the green **Code** button.  
2. Select **Download ZIP**.  
3. Once the ZIP file downloads, **unzip it** (extract the files) into a folder on your computer.  
4. Open the folder in your code editor (like VS Code).

✅ **Tip:** If you’re new to Git, start with the ZIP download.  
But as you get more comfortable, try cloning with Git — it will make your workflow much smoother!
